properties:
  odr:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
          Accelerometer sampling frequency (ODR). Default is power on reset value.
            0 # 12.5Hz
            1 # 25Hz
            2 # 50Hz
            3 # 100Hz
            4 # 200Hz
            5 # 400Hz

  int1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The INT1 signal defaults to active high as produced by the
      sensor.  The property value should ensure the flags properly
      describe the signal that is presented to the driver.
  
  fifo-mode:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      Configures the FIFO mode of the sensor. Possible values are:
        0 # FIFO disabled, only one dataset is ever stored
        1 # FIFO enabled, save oldest
        2 # FIFO enabled, stream mode
        3 # FIFO enabled, triggered mode
      The default is 2, as FIFO mode is generally easier to use.
  fifo-samples:
    type: int
    default: 0x80
    description: |
      Number of samples to store in the FIFO. Range 0-511. The
      default is 0x80h which matches the default on the device.
  temp-en:
    type: boolean

      Enable the integrated temperature sensor and fetch its data
